What is the description for fluidity?,"Fluidity is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that focuses on solving the utility problem in the DeFi space. It allows users to wrap stablecoins, such as USDC, converting them into their fluid asset counterparts (e.g., fUSDC). This process generates yield, which comes from lending out the underlying assets on money markets. Fluidity utilizes an incentive mechanism to reward users for on-chain transactions, making it a ""spend-to-earn"" protocol. 

In October 2022, Fluidity raised $1.3 million in a seed funding round led by Multicoin Capital, with support from various investors, and is aimed at enhancing its offerings, including mainnet launches and additional features like Utility Mining.","is, a, decentralized, finance, Fluidity"
