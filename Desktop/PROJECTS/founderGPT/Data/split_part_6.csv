What is the description for WATCHES.IO?,"WATCHES.IO is a Miami-based startup that is innovating the $75 billion luxury watch market by providing a comprehensive financial platform for tracking, trading, and investing in luxury watches. The platform allows users to monitor their watch portfolios with real-time market data, making it similar to trading platforms for stocks or cryptocurrencies.

Recently, WATCHES.IO raised $1.9 million in a pre-seed funding round, led by Lemniscap and supported by various notable web3 investors. Their goal is to create an end-to-end tracking and trading ecosystem for watches, including a watch-backed NFT infrastructure, which will enable seamless buy/sell transactions. This innovation turns luxury watches into tradable assets, appealing particularly to Gen Z and millennials who view watches as investments rather than mere accessories.

The company was founded by Jake Plonskier, a watch enthusiast, and aims to provide features such as secure escrow and authentication for transactions, as well as options for physical delivery or NFT-based ownership of watches. Their approach opens new avenues for watch collectors, allowing them to leverage their assets in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.","is, a, Miami-based, WATCHES.IO, startup"
